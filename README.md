Challenges Encountered
1. Building a Comprehensive Database
Creating a unified database for tracking and analyzing social media data across multiple platforms was a major challenge. We solved this by using Astra DB, creating a data pipeline to normalize and standardize incoming data, and optimizing queries to ensure fast performance even with large datasets.

2. Selecting the Right Model for Social Media Analysis
Choosing the best AI model to generate insights and recommendations was complex. We decided on LLaMA 3.1 (8B), an open-source model, and fine-tuned it using domain-specific datasets. The integration of LangFlow allowed for better orchestration of tasks, such as trend prediction and content analysis.
